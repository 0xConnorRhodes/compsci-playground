# compsci-playground
Projects completed as part of a series of self-taught CS courses. This repo is similar to my [Python Playground repo](https://github.com/0xConnorRhodes/python-playground) but contains exercises from courses designed to teach the foundations of computer science.

Much of the material explored in this repo is inspired by [OSSU's Computer Science Degree Program](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) and Harvard University's [CS50 computer science curriculum](https://cs50.harvard.edu/).
